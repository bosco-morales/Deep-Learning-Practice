Assignment: Neural Network Project for Regression and Binary Classification
Instructor: Dr. Ernesto Lee

Course: Advanced Special Topics (Neural Networks)

Due Date: Monday (Next Class)

Objective:
In this assignment, you will work in groups of up to three to identify your own dataset and build neural networks for two use cases: regression and binary classification. You will record and analyze the performance of your models.

Instructions:
Form Groups:

You may work individually or in groups of up to three members.
Dataset Selection:

Choose a dataset that you are interested in. Ensure that the dataset is suitable for both regression and binary classification tasks.
You can use publicly available datasets from sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other reputable data source.
Data Preparation:

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Neural Network for Regression:

Build and compile a neural network model for the regression task using TensorFlow/Keras.
Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.
Record the performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
Neural Network for Binary Classification:

Build and compile a neural network model for the binary classification task using TensorFlow/Keras.
Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.
Record the performance metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
Performance Analysis:

Compare the performance of your models. Discuss any challenges faced during data preparation, model building, and evaluation.
Provide visualizations such as loss and accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and any other relevant charts.
Report Submission:

Document your findings in a report. The report should include:
Introduction to the chosen dataset and its relevance.
Detailed steps of data preprocessing.
Architecture and configuration of the neural network models.
Training and evaluation results.
Analysis and conclusions.
Include code snippets and relevant visualizations in the report.
Submission Format:

Submit the report in your Colab notebook with your code.
Ensure that the notebook is well-commented and organized.
